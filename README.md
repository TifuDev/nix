### Developing

At first, you should install some development dependencies with the command:

`pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt`

Now, with the dependencies installed, it's time to add the [pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks)

`pre-commit install`

#### Linting

The lint process is one of the must important part of developing a new feature. Make a code readable will make the code easy to understand.
For this process we make use of the [Pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) tool.
